# System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for our platform. 

## 1. High-Level Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific functionality. 

- **Frontend:** Built using React, providing a dynamic user interface.
- **Backend:** Developed with Flask, handling API requests and business logic.
- **Database:** Utilizes MySQL for data storage and retrieval.

## 3. Data Flow
The data flow between the components is as follows:
- Users interact with the frontend, which sends requests to the backend API.
- The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses to the frontend.
